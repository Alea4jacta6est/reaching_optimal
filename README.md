# Efficient Computations in Python

Instructions to do the task

•	Create a text file that has numbers from 1 to 100000, save it as 'input.txt'
•	In the Python code, read in the input file
•	Now, perform following operations in parallel :
o	Each number in the input.txt is multiplied by n, where n is configurable
o	Each number in the input.txt is added to the next number, eg: in the input file with numbers 1,2,3,4….., the result will look like 3,5,7,9….
o	For each operation, the start time and end time as well as every 100th result should be logged using the logging module of Python
•	This assignment will not be judged on the basis of correct functional result but on the basis of approach and efficiency of writing Python code
•	You should use Python as the programming language
•	Wherever possible, expose the service as an API.
•	It is fine if the given assignment is not completed in the given timeframe or does not meet your standards. We will discuss the content of what has been submitted.
